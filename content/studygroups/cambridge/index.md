abstract: This report describes the response to the ’hydraulic modelling of collection net-works  for  civil  engineering  applications’  challenge  set  by  Sweco  at  the  second  Environmental  Modelling  in  Industry  Study  Group.    The  solution  was  developed  in workshops hosted by the Turing Gateway to Mathematics at the Newton Institute in Cambridge on 3-6 April 2017.  The industry standard modelling practice of omitting the  explicit  representation  of  the  collection  network,  road  gullies  for  example,  was examined by the team.  This approach was found to significantly underestimate the exchange of water between 2D and 1D model domains.  A solution was proposed in which  the  gullies  are  replaced  by  a  line  source/sink  of  carefully  chosen  intensity  in order to represent the lumped behaviour of multiple road gullies.  Two separate 2D surface  models,  based  on  the  full  shallow  water  equations  and  their  diffusive  wave approximation respectively, were used to test the solution.  By comparing the results of simulations in which the gully sinks are explicitly modelled with those containing a  line  sink  the  performance  of  the  parametrisation  was  found  to  be  excellent.   Future test cases are proposed, most importantly involving flows with strong coupling between the 2D surface flow and 1D sewer flow, which should be carried out before implementation of the parametrisation is recommended.
