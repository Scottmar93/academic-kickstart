abstract: Mocean Energy is an Edinburgh-based company developing devices (wave energy converters) that capture energy from the ocean's waves and convert it to electrical energy. The company's current device design was the result of an optimisation algorithm that aimed to minimise the ratio of cost to energy production of such devices. The geometry of the resulting device displayed a unique feature of 'wave channels', which are sloped channels on the fore and aft of the device. The resulting design exhibits, what the company term, 'wave resonance' inside the wave channels, leading to large waves experienced by the device. However, the origin of this wave phenomenon is not clear. In particular, the optimisation algorithm relies on the validity of linear wave theory, which cannot capture large free-surface elevations. Mocean Energy would like to investigate the physical mechanism causing this phenomenon to occur. In particular, they would like to understand if these resonance events are actually excited 'trapped modes', which occur close to a body in wave-structure interaction.
