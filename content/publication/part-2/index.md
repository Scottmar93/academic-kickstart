abstract: We consider a model of the electrochemical and thermal behaviour of a single layer lithium-ion pouch cell and systematically consider model simplifications derived through asymptotic analysis. The analysis begins from a potential pair or "2+1D" model, derived in Part I, in which the behaviour in the current collectors is modelled in 2D and at every point in this 2D description there is a pseudo 2D model describing the through-cell electrochemical behaviour. We consider various limiting cases, particularly relating to the conductivity of the current collectors and to the magnitude of the applied current to derive greatly simplified versions of the model. These are critically compared and it is shown that in many practical situations simple models are sufficiently accurate. The simplified models are easily interpreted, and have the benefits of being less complex and of remove the algebraic parts of the system which require treatment by specialised, and often computationally expensive, numerical techniques. The resulting model is of similar complexity to a one-dimensional reduced order battery model, but allows for spatial distributions in the current collector potentials to be computed in a consistent manner.
