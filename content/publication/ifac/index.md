abstract: This paper presents a fully Bayesian parameter estimation analysis for a type of lithium-ion batteries model, to determine the uniqueness, evaluate the sensitivity and quantify uncertainty of the model parameters with respect to an input-output prediction-estimation problem. The analysis considers a highly accurate single particle model with electrolyte dynamics, rigorously derived from an asymptotic analysis including electrode-average terms. The Bayesian approach used allows addressing multi-modal target distributions which enable a global analysis of the parameter space under non-restrictive scenarios. The analysis focuses on the identification problem under a set of discrete local states of charge in comparison with a continuous excursion of it. The performance of the methodology proposed is evaluated using synthetic data from multiple numerical simulations under diverse types of current excitations.
