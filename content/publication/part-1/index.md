abstract: A three-dimensional model of a single layer lithium-ion pouch cell is presented which couples conventional porous electrode theory describing cell electrochemical behaviour with an energy balance describing cell thermal behaviour. Asymptotic analysis of the model is carried out by exploiting the small aspect ratio typical of pouch cell designs. The analysis reveals the scalings that give distinguished limits of the parameters, and the role the electrical and thermal conductivities play in controlling how the model is simplified is discussed. In particular, we show that in a suitable limit the resulting simplified model comprises a collection of one-dimensional models for the through-cell electrochemical behaviour which are coupled via a two-dimensional problems for the Ohmic and thermal behaviour in the planar current collectors. Such a model has been derived in an ad-hoc manner in the literature and is in common use for modelling pouch cells. However, we give a systematic derivation of the model to allow further systematic simplification and to enable additional corrections to be found to make the model either more computationally efficient or more accurate. Computations of the simplified model and comparison of the results to full calculations are presented and demonstrate the power of the methodology and the accuracy of the simplification.
