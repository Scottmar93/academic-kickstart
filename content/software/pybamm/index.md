abstract: As the UK battery modelling community grows, there is a clear need for software that  uses  modern  software  engineering  techniques  to  facilitate  cross-institutional collaboration and democratise research progress. The Python package PyBaMM aims to provide a flexible platform  for implementation and comparison of new models and numerical methods. This is achieved by implementing models as expression trees and processing them in a modular fashion through a pipeline. Comprehensive testing provides robustness to changes and hence eases the implementation of model extensions. PyBaMM is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM).

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
