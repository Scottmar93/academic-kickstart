 I am a final year DPhil student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Oxford.
 My DPhil project is on the mathematical modelling of lithium-ion batteries and is being
 conducted in collaboration with Siemens. My focus within this project has been on the development of
 reduced-order physics-based mathematical models of lithium-ion batteries which accurately
 reproduce the behaviour of more detailed full-order physics-based models but at a fraction of
 the computational cost. I have also been working collaboratively with other researchers and
 software engineers to implement a suite of these reduced-order and full-order models within a
 well-tested, well-documented, and easy-to-use software
 called [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM).

After my DPhil, I am really keen to build upon my work modelling lithium-ion batteries and apply
my results and knowledge within industry. In particular, I would like to direct my focus
towards improving battery diagnostic and control systems for
electric vehicles and/or grid-scale energy storage.
